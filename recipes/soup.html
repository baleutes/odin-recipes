        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Soup season calls for this chicken pot pie soup with pie crust dumplings. Folded pie-dough pieces play the part of bouncy dumplings, and rotisserie chicken shortens the cook time. If you like, swap the Italian seasoning for chili powder or curry powder.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie dough</li>
            <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 (10.5-ounce) can condensed cream of onion soup</li>
            <li>2 cups coarsely shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li>2 cups frozen peas and carrots</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>Fresh thyme sprigs, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll pie crust into a 12-inch circle. Cut with a sharp knife or pizza cutter into 7 strips, then cut crosswise into 7 strips, discarding any scraps. You should have about 40 squares. Cover squares with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>To form dumplings, working with 1 square at a time, lightly brush edges with water. Lift opposite corners to meet, then press to seal and form a triangle. Repeat with remaining squares, keeping dumplings covered with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Whisk together broth and condensed soup in a large Dutch oven. Stir in chicken, frozen vegetables, Italian seasoning, pepper, and garlic powder. Bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until vegetables and chicken are heated through, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gently stir dumplings into soup. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until dumplings are tender and soup is slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Garnish servings with fresh thyme and additional pepper.</li>
        </ol>
